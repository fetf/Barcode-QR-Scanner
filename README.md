## Inspiration
We wanted to try something new using the camera of a phone.
## What it does
This app scans barcodes/QR codes and keeps a history of them.
## How I built it
We built this app using the React Native framework and Javascript.
## Challenges I ran into
We needed to learn the aspects of asynchronous programming in order to store the history data.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The app works as intended with history data persisting after every use.
## What I learned
We learned how to code with React Native and how to combine asynchronous code with a synchronous program.
## What's next for Barcode/QR code scanner
We will add new features!
